# ticTac
This is a project for a simple tic-tac-toe part of The Odin Project

# Features
# Human playing
    Here you will be able to challenge another person in the game and the winner will be anniunced which will then
    require you to restart the game with the restart button.

# Robot Opponent
    Here you will play against an unbeatable AI computer player designed to beat you in every possible way.

1. Algorithm
    This AI player uses the Minimax algorithm that maximizes itself and minimizes the other player(you).
    It then goes through all the possible moves and chooses the best move to either win or prevent the other 
    player from winning.
